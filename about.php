With our free service you will be able to register all of your pets and provide any important information about them. Each registered pet will recieve a 'petID' which can be used to lookup their information if they are found. The information you provide will only be available if your pet is marked as lost, and someone enters the petID of your pet.<br><br>In other words, Stray Alert works like a free and publicly accessible alternative to microchiping. We also make it easy for you to keep all of your information up to date.<br><br>Our service is also meant to be used as a central place to report found pets that do not have a petID. </ol> ";
